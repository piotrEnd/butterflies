**Information architecture:**

Preservation of butterflies is undeniably a niche, and the process resembles artistic craftsmanship. The primary page outlines the sequential stages: capturing, selecting, preparing, and exhibiting. It portrays the effort required to craft each individual specimen, reinforcing the rationale for potential premium pricing. A succinct artisan profile introduces the creator to the consumer. The subsequent page highlights product features and provides an online shopping option with a secure PayPal checkout. The third page covers the additional facet of organizing exhibitions and incorporates a testimonials segment. Lastly, the final page provides essential contact information.

**Design:**

The multi-page design is a fitting choice for accommodating business growth, offering effortless scalability in the future. While the pages share a common structure, each unit has a unique linear gradient. This design element not only references the wide variety of species but also subtly alludes to their iridescent colors. Made with the Materialize CSS framework.
